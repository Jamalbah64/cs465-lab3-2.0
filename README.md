# Lab 3 and 4

My Qzicl project that I had to redo from scratch. Apparently, I overcomplicated the project by using React + Vite which wasn't a good idea since it meant my main.jsx could never be read during runtime. Revised the whole lab assignment to make the quiz webpage actually show up as a static html file with interactable buttons to change the current view for the browser.

Backend directory must be run with "node server.js" in one terminal, while the client directory is run with "npm run dev" in another terminal.
